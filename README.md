# Sorting Algorithms Visualization
This project is a web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms. It provides a visual representation of how different sorting methods rearrange elements in an array to achieve a sorted order. Each sorting algorithm is accompanied by a detailed step-by-step explanation of its operation.

## Features
* Visualization: Watch sorting algorithms in action through visual bars representing array elements.
* Algorithm Selection: Choose from Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
* Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing.
* Performance Metrics: View sorting performance metrics such as time complexity and stability.
* Step-by-Step Explanation: Understand each algorithm's logic through detailed explanations.
## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React.js for building interactive user interfaces.
* Styling: Custom CSS for layout and design.

## Purpose
This project aims to demonstrate different sorting algorithms in a visual and educational manner. It serves as a tool for learning and understanding how sorting algorithms work under different scenarios and input sizes.
